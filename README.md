# Flappy Bird Machine Learning

Original game mechanics taken from [this repo](http://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning). I extracted the Neuroevolution and added my own implementation of tensorflow.js.

Inspired on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUNkwXx-I4) from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).
